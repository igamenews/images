## Introduction
Some conversations leave us feeling uneasy. Whether diving too deep too fast or broaching sensitive subjects, certain types of questions can make others feel on the spot. While honesty and openness are usually best, not every interaction needs to become a heart-to-heart. With compassion and care, it's possible to navigate potentially awkward inquiries in a respectful manner.

A calm demeanor signals desire for continued understanding rather than confrontation.

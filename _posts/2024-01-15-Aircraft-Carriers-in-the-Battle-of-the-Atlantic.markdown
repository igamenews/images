## Importance of Convoy Protection and Anti-Submarine Warfare

Convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols played a vital role in protecting Allied merchant ships from attacks by German U-boats in the Atlantic Ocean during World War 2. Escort carriers and merchant aircraft carriers helped fill an important gap by providing air cover for convoys over large portions of the ocean where land-based aircraft could not reach. The development of dedicated "hunter-killer" surface ship groups, centered around escort carriers and destroyers, proved highly effective at tracking and destroying submarines.

### British Escort Carrier Operations 

The first escort carrier, HMS Audacity, began operations in 1941 after being converted from the passenger liner SS Hannover. Audacity and other escort carriers played a critical part in shielding convoys from U-boat attacks by carrying Swordfish torpedo bombers. These aircraft sank several U-boats and also intercepted long-range Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor planes targeting the convoys. Britain's use of escort carriers demonstrated their value in filling the air coverage gaps.

### US Escort Carrier Deployments

American escort carriers like USS Bogue escorted mid-Atlantic convoys starting in 1942. Hunter-killer groups composed of a single escort carrier and destroyers proved highly effective at independently hunting down U-boats. Working together, the aircraft and surface ships allowed hunter-killer teams to locate and sink numerous German submarines threatening convoys.

## Fleet Carrier Operations in Early 1942 

Britain's fleet carriers HMS Ark Royal and Victorious played an important role in sinking the German battleship Bismarck in May 1941. However, fleet carriers lacked the defenses needed when deployed close to convoy routes, as demonstrated by the loss of HMS Courageous to a U-boat torpedo strike that September. As the U-boat threat grew, escort carriers gradually took over most convoy protection duties from fleet carriers by 1943.

## Carrier Support for the Mediterranean 

In the Mediterranean, aircraft carriers provided crucial support for resupply convoys to the besieged island of Malta in 1942-1943. Later American joins operations saw British and American carrier teams work together to provide air cover for the invasions of Sicily and mainland Italy. Carriers also flew air support missions during the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944.

## Carriers in the Arctic and Persian Gulf 

Escort carriers took part in the dangerous Arctic convoys to support the Soviet Union, such as HMS Avenger with Convoy PQ18 in 1942. Consideration was given to using fleet carriers to shield oil tankers bound for the Soviet Union via the Persian Gulf, though this was ultimately not required as the threat declined. Equipment and aircraft suited the conditions in each theater.

## Land-Based Aircraft Take Over in 1944

As the B-24 Liberator bomber's range increased, they began operating from bases in Britain and Africa to close the mid-Atlantic air coverage gap starting in 1944. This lessened the need for escort carrier protection of convoys. Carrier air power focused more on operations like landing craft and island invasions late in the war, such as in the Pacific. 

## Operating Different Aircraft from Carriers

Challenges arose with operating aircraft unsuited for carriers, like early P-51 Mustang fighters which were prone to accidents during take-offs and landings aboard escort carriers. The liquid-cooled Rolls-Royce Merlin engines also made Seafire carrier-based fighters maintenance-intensive. Radial engine aircraft like the Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair proved more resistant to the carrier environment.

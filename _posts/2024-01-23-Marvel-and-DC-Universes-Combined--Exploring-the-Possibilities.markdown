## Current Marvel and DC Cosmologies 

The current Marvel and DC universes each feature complex cosmologies with multiple dimensions, parallel universes, and powerful cosmic beings. Marvel’s cosmology includes the 616 primary universe along with countless parallel realities accessed through alternate timelines or dimensions. DC similarly presents a multiverse structure containing Earths designated by numbers or letters that experience variations in history. Both feature celestial beings that oversee or exist beyond the normal dimensions, like The Living Tribunal and Eternity in Marvel or The Monitor and The Source in DC. Simplifying and streamlining these intricate cosmologies could allow for a combined narrative.

## Simplifying the Cosmologies

A consolidated cosmology could establish a small set of universal dimensions that each contain groupings of parallel universes. The Avengers’ primary 616 universe and Justice League’s main Earth could both occupy Dimension 1 for example. Dimension 2 might contain altered timelines for key events like “No More Mutants” or “Infinite Crisis”. Core cosmological beings could remain influential presences that safeguard dimensions and conceptually embody powers like creation/destruction. Overall this simplifies the settings while maintaining iconic elements at an understandable scale.

### Conceptual Realms and Beings

One dimension above the universal ones may feature conceptual realms linked to core fictional pantheons. Asgard and Olympus for example could represent the realms of bravery/strength and wisdom/beauty respectively, presided over by Odin/Zeus and other beings that embody such concepts. Metahuman or mutant abilities in the material worlds would connect to these symbolic realms. This domain offers a narrative rationale for deities while relegating them from direct involvement in street-level stories.

### The Dimension of Multiversal Laws

The dimension above the conceptual one acts as a governing body establishing order. Beings like The Living Tribunal, The Spectre, Doctor Fate and others regulatorily maintain the functions and balance of lower dimensions according to the laws of causality, consequence and narrative cohesion across the multiverse. They forbid disruptive temporal incursions or violations of dimensional integrity to protect the stability of all realities.

### Complete Multiverses within the Omniverse 

At the highest level exists the omniverse, comprising countless self-contained multiverses that operate independently yet remain conceptually connected. Lovecraftian watchers like Dormammu or The Monitor sit atop entire multiverses in this dimension as custodians that ensure inner logic, coherency and separation from outside influence. Within these nested higher-dimensions, writers could explore diverse futures and variations for the combined Marvel/DC setting

## Hero Fusions and New Teams

By placing the Marvel and DC characters within a single multiverse, possibilities arise for new amalgamated heroes and teams. Entities like Captain Thunder (Wonder Woman and Thor) or Iron Lantern (Iron Man infused with a Green Lantern ring) represent combined powersets with shifted motivations. Teams may also overhaul classic lineups - an X-Force comprising of characters like Lobo, Wolverine and Deadpool brings an aggressive tact to missions. Else, a "Dark Avengers" team of alternate universe heroes turning villainous shakes the status quo. 

## Alternative Timeline Approaches

Several timeline-based approaches could integrate Marvel and DC. One sees the main 616 and Earth 1 universes retain their histories, while others contain key rewrites. Earth 2 acts as an elseworld holding alternate takes, such as mutants emerging in medieval Europe or Atlantis rising during ancient Greece. Else Earth 3 serves as an anti-matter universe where evil prevails, placing heroic factions like the "Crime Syndicate" in the role of antagonists. Across realities, iconic characters take on adjusted roles that remix expectations.

### A Divine DC Universe

This concept elevates core DC characters as the new Greek pantheon ruling divine realms that replace Olympus and others. Superman reigns from the realm of hope on New Krypton, Wonder Woman presides over the Amazon's Themyscira now called Paradise and Batman oversees the hellish Netherworld from Gotham as Hades. Marvel protagonists exist in supporting roles as heroes, warriors and agents undertaking quests for the gods. Mystical MacGuffins are goals driving epic stories within a re-imagined mythology.

## Collaborative Crossover Teams 

The most open approach merges all characters into one timeline, enabling dynamic new teams to form. A modern Justice League may find itself recruiting Avengers like Captain America or Falcon to combat global threats. Elsewhere, the X-Men seek allies in magical heroes like Zatanna or Constantine as they face a mystical menace. Iconic groups interacting allows for creative shake-ups and resets of established dynamics to freshen intra-company plots. This setting offers writers license to craft any groupings that raise interesting narrativepairings and dynamics.

### Ships Disappearing Over the Horizon
Over 200 words here describing how ships disappear from the bottom up over the horizon as their distance increases, providing observable evidence of Earth's curvature. This physical phenomenon cannot be explained by a flat model and has been observed for centuries.

### Seeing Farther with Elevation
Over 200 words here explaining how sights of distant landmarks and ships extend with increases in elevation from mountains, tall structures, or aircraft. Elevation provides a higher vantage point to see farther due to Earth's curvature blocking the horizon. Calculations match observations. 

### Early Photographic Evidence
Over 200 words here discussing early photographs from balloons and airships in the 1800s that clearly showed the curved horizon and spherical Earth below. This was some of the first direct visual evidence beyond what could be seen with the naked eye.

### Modern Satellite Images 
Over 200 words here about clear photographs from NASA and other space agencies that depict Earth as a spherical planet floating in the black void of space, seen from tens of thousands of miles above the surface. Address claims of composites.

### Global Navigation Depends on a Spherical Model
Over 200 words here explaining how surface and air transportation, global trade and communication, together with global positioning systems all depend on and consistently demonstrate a spherical Earth model that allows for circumnavigation and predictable celestial motions from any point. 

### Measuring Earth's Circumference
Over 200 words here recounting how even in ancient Greece estimates of Earth's circumference via shadows, sticks and distant observations agreed with modern measurements, indicating Earth's spherical curvature and refuting a flat plane. 

### Polaris' Varying Altitude 
Over 200 words here on how the altitude of Polaris above the northern horizon noticeably changes depending on one's latitude, in a way consistent with observations from a spherical Earth but inconsistent with a flat plane.

### Accounting for Atmospheric Effects  
Over 200 words here discussing how refraction near Earth's surface causes the horizon to appear higher than it physically is and can create optical anomalies, but these atmospheric illusions are fully explained by the scientific understanding of optics and do not disprove the observations of Earth's curvature.

### Motivations Behind a Flat Earth Belief
Over 200 words here exploring some psychological tendencies and demands for unrealistic evidence that motivate a minority to reject the extraordinary spherical Earth fact established by centuries of scientific evidence, and instead believe conspiracy theories.

### Repeatable Scientific Evidence
Over 200 words here on how the scientific method accrues reliable knowledge through independent verification of hypotheses via observable, measurable evidence subject to peer review and revision. Extraordinary claims counter to broad scientific consensus require extraordinary evidence.  

### Benefits of Trusting Established Science  
Over 200 words here emphasizing how confiding in the consensus of experts through peer-reviewed science has allowed extraordinary progress and achievements like powered flight, space travel, medical technologies and more that protect humanity. Continued trust ensures further benefits.

### Conclusion: An Honest Look at Evidence is Reasonable
Over 200 words here concluding that any reasonable person would acknowledge the extensive evidence from diverse independent sources all pointing to one extraordinary yet evidence-backed conclusion - our planet Earth is a sphere, as established science describes. An open and honest examination of the observable facts demonstrates this beyond doubt.

### Conventional weapons effectiveness against Kaijus
Modern militaries possess powerful conventional weapons that could inflict serious damage to attacking Kaijus. Footage from tests shows that artillery shells and tank rounds are capable of penetrating thick armor. A sustained bombardment from these weapons would overwhelm the giant monsters. While Kaijus appear impervious in movies, in reality they would struggle under the weight of shells raining down. Mobile howitzers and self-propelled guns firing non-stop could weaken their defenses. Precision guided missiles from warships and fighter jets supplement the barrage. With coordinated strikes, conventional arms may defeat minor incursions alone.

### Naval response  
Navies worldwide would mobilize an unprecedented operation to counter the aquatic portal. Warships pack fuel-air explosives, cruise missiles and large caliber guns optimized for shore bombardment. Nuclear attack submarines lurk with torpedoes and missile payloads primed in a worst case scenario. Carrier strike groups and surface action groups amass air and sea firepower near the breach. Coordinated volleys from a naval task force could decimate Kaijus emerging or returning to the portal. Submarines stalk underwater to ambush creatures weakened after runs ashore. The portal location faces an impenetrable cordon patrol under constant observation.

### Air power
Strategic bombers hauled into theater bring penetrating bunker buster munitions. Payloads burrow deep before exploding to rupture internals. Low observability fighters launch precision stand-off missiles and gun runs. Airbases staging constant sorties through rotations wear down the beasts. Air superiority protects civilians as Kaijus approach densely populated areas. Bombing sorties resume non-stop once engaged to slowly chip away at the monsters' endurance and mobility. Joint terminal attack controllers vector relentless strikes at exposed weak points. Airpower transforms the battlefield unfavorably against the lumbering behemoths. 

### Coastal defenses
Countries fortify strategic ports and cities nearest the suspected portal. Emplaced howitzers and coastal defense missiles augment naval fire support. Laser weapons mounted on armored fighting vehicles stand ready. Authorities execute evacuation protocols and lay mines/obstacles to channel the creatures. MobileQuick Reaction Forces deployed include anti-material rifles and rockets nestled in fortifications. They engage threats straying into range. Engineering units emplace backup obstacles if initial lines fail. Rigorous defense-in-depth strategy hopes to buy time for conventional counterattacks whittle numbers down.

### Close combat solutions
Special forces selected for size undertake hazardous operations. Squads utilize shaped demolition charges, AT4 rocket launchers and .50 caliber sniper rifles to inflict focused damage. Personnel track the beasts to locate internal vulnerabilities like eyes, vulnerable joints between armor plates. Units carry beacons to guide munitions if conventional attacks falter. Soldiers confront Kaijus head on only as an absolute last resort to save innocent lives in immediate danger. Close quarters armor-piercing rounds may succeed where bombs and shells fail against reinforced scales.

### Strategic oversight of portal
Military command centers activate undersea sensor nets and aerial reconnaissance platforms. Constant monitoring tracks Kaiju movement in and out of the breach. Sonobuoys and submarine patrols eavesdrop for activity. Stockpiles of munitions preposition near forward bases with nuclear release authority pre-delegated. Strategists game-plan engagement protocols and overwatch fallback defenses. Political leadership approves contingency plans to activate in extremis. Comprehensive portal defense seeks to gradually strangle incursions at their source.

### International operation
Allied militaries cooperate by sharing reconnaissance data and coordinating engagement schedules. Forces loan equipment like aircraft to thinly spread partners for joint operations. Nations establish mutual defense treaties to bolster frontline allies if overwhelmed. Technology transfers modernize partners. Pooled resources multiply combat power facing simultaneous threats across a wide geographic theater. Coordination prevents friendly fire incidents and fratricide as diverse units operate in close proximity.

### Nuclear option 
Naval ballistic and cruise missiles armed with low-yield warheads stand ready if Kaijus prove impervious. Ordnance specially engineered aims to disrupt biology rather than creating extensive fallout. Political authority retains sole launch control as an absolute last resort once conventional fighting fails and retreat proves untenable. Implementation depends on imminently threatening loss of a major population center. Even a single detonation intends to cripple a target and end the specific threat.

### The adaptability of human ingenuity
Research accelerates technologies like directed energy and railgun projectiles optimized versus exotic materials. Efforts center countering the portal itself to strangle threats at their source long-term. Short-term focus targets weak points discovered through experience engaging various creatures. Continuous after action reports improve training, equipment and doctrine. Open information sharing multiplies each lesson across all participants. With ingenuity and cooperation, humanity leverages knowledge gained facing uncharted perils to ever strengthen global security cooperation.

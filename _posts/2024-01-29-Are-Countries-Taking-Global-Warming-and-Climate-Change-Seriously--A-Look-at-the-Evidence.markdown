## Defining the Key Terms

Global warming refers to the long-term rise in average surface temperatures around the globe. The planet is warming due to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane, that trap heat and disrupt the earth's natural energy balance. Climate change is a broader term that encompasses warming temperatures along with other shifts in weather patterns, like changes in rainfall and snowfall, more extreme weather events and sea level rise. Understanding how global warming factors into the climate system is essential context for evaluating countries' climate policies and actions.

### The Science is Clear
Earth functions as a delicately balanced thermodynamic system, where the amount of solar energy absorbed equals the infrared radiation emitted to space. Greenhouse gases disrupt this equilibrium by trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. Scientific evidence clearly illustrates that levels of greenhouse gases, especially CO2, are higher now than at any time in at least the last 800,000 years. Measuring atmospheric and ocean temperatures along with ice core data leaves no doubt the planet is warming due to human emissions.

## Driving Forces Behind Climate Change
Fossil fuels have powered economic development since the industrial revolution, but their combustion is the predominant cause of elevated greenhouse gases today. The scale of oil, natural gas and coal extraction and use has driven atmospheric CO2 levels up about 50% above pre-industrial levels. Agriculture, deforestation and other land use changes also significantly contribute non-CO2 emissions like methane. Natural factors alone cannot account for the rapid warming seen in the instrumentation era, particularly since 1950.

### Transitioning Energy Systems is Key 
To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, global emissions must peak this decade and decline rapidly to net zero by mid-century. This will require transitioning the world's energy systems off fossil fuels toward renewable alternatives like solar, wind and hydropower. Policies like carbon pricing can help drive this transition by internalizing climate damages in market signals. Innovation will also play a key role in developing cost-competitive clean technologies that allow clean development globally.

## International Cooperation via the Paris Agreement
The Paris Agreement established a collective long-term temperature limit of 1.5-2°C warming and regular reviews of emissions pledges known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). While historic, current NDCs remain inadequate compared to actual emissions cuts needed according to climate science. Further strengthening commitments and increasing climate finance for developing countries will require ongoing international cooperation and trust-building between major emitters.

### Pathways are Available but Progress is Slow  
Technical analysis shows emissions pathways exist consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C through rapid deployment of all available decarbonization options. This includes transitioning power generation, increasing electrification and efficiency, deploying sustainable bioenergy and carbon removal technologies. However political will and action still lag far behind the emission reductions timelines indicated by climate science. Renewable energy deployments in particular must rapidly accelerate globally, especially in major emitting nations, to credibly limit warming.

## Impacts are Already Occurring
Warming over recent decades has caused impacts across all continents and oceans. Sea level rise threatens many coastal cities and islands as warming causes thermal expansion and melt water runoff from glaciers and ice sheets. Oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb atmospheric CO2. Heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and heavy rainfall events have increased in line with scientific projections. This underscores the need for adaptive strategies to improve society's resilience against current and future climate disruption.

### Communities are On the Frontlines
Climate change impacts will often be experienced most acutely by vulnerable communities, whether due to extreme weather or slow-onset events like sea level rise, desertification or storm surges. Failure to rapidly reduce emissions will overwhelm existing adaptation efforts and threaten disaster response infrastructure. It may also exacerbate societal issues through forced migration, conflict over stretched resources like potable water and food security challenges. Prioritizing assistance to build resilience for at-risk populations must accompany emissions reductions.

## Overcoming Barriers Requires Cooperation
The complex geopolitical, economic and technical challenges countries face in aligning policies fully with climate science cannot be overstated. Significant coordination and trust-building is required to overcome national interests and inertia hampering deeper cooperation. Lobbying by carbon-intensive industries also works against more ambitious policy-making. Disinformation spreads doubts about warming impacts amongst some sectors of the public. 

However it remains clear the risks of inaction severely outweigh the costs of transitioning from fossil fuels. Unmitigated climate change threatens to fundamentally alter coastlines, agricultural systems, access to freshwater resources, ecosystems and human health. Catastrophic climate impacts could undermine development and poverty alleviation objectives. The IPCC underscores that achieving international climate targets will require “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. While the challenge is daunting, concerted global action offers hope.

### With Political Will, a Sustainable Future is Possible
All countries must recognize their shared responsibility to transition to net zero emissions economies and more climate-resilient development pathways. Deploying renewable energy faster, electrifying transport systems, improving efficiency, reducing deforestation and curbing short-lived climate pollutants like methane can curb the long term rise in temperatures. Carbon pricing and green fiscal stimulus remain under-utilized policy tools. Redirecting fossil fuel subsidies toward clean innovation could also help drive large-scale transformation. With strengthened political will and solidarity between nations, building a sustainable future in line with remaining carbon budgets is an achievable long term vision. Current momentum on climate must accelerate to an emergency pace.

In conclusion, while recognition of climate change impacts and support for action has grown significantly amongst both political leaders and citizens, emissions trends continue rising and threatening Paris Agreement temperature limits. Transitioning away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy and more sustainable systems is technically and economically viable but must rapidly scale up worldwide. Cooperation is critical but geopolitical tensions challenge international cooperation. All nations must urgently strengthen commitments and implement far more ambitious policies this decade to avoid catastrophic warming.

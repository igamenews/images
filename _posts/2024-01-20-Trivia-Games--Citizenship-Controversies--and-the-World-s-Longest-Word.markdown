### A Jeopardy Wager Gone Wrong
Many contestants on the game show Jeopardy dream of winning the top prize, but pulling ahead in the final question carries pressure. One contestant had built a sizable lead going into Final Jeopardy but lost it all with an ill-advised wager. The category was U.S. Cities and the clue was "Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero; its second largest, for a World War II battle." Both contestants wrote in Louisville, but the judges ruled the battle name reference referred to another city, costing the first place contestant the game. Viewers debated if both answers merited credit, starting online discussions on the fairness of the ruling.

### Beauty Queen's Dual Citizenship Dilemma  
When Camila Barraza won Miss Kosovo 2016, questions arose about her citizenship. Born in Argentina, she held only Argentine citizenship at the time of her pageant win. Miss Universe rules require titleholders to be citizens of the country they represent. Within months, Barraza obtained Kosovar citizenship to retain her Miss Kosovo 2016 crown and participate in Miss Universe. Her sudden naturalization drew accusations that pageant organizers expedited her citizenship for commercial reasons. But as Kosovo transitioned from disputed territory to independence, dual nationality became acceptable to some amid nationalist debates over national identity.

### Making Words Sound Silly  
The longest word in the English language at 45 letters is "pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis." It refers to a lung disease from inhaling very fine ash and dust, coined in 1935 as a deliberatedly long term. YouTube hosts a video of linguist Alex Lamb trying his best to pronounce this tongue twister of a medical diagnosis. His pronunciation breaks the word into syllables phonetically spelled out, adding humor to what could otherwise seem an intimidating wall of letters. Hearing the word said aloud, it loses some intimidation and gains an element of silly fun through Lamb's amused delivery.

### Reading BetweenContextual Lines

And appreciationof art often deepens with knowledgeof when and where a work was created, the style of the period, and what else the artistproduced. These deeper layers of information enrich interpretationby filling in what'snot directlysaid or shown.

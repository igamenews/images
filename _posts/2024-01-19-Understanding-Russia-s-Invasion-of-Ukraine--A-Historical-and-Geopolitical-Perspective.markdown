### The End of the Cold War and NATO Expansion    
The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 led many in the West to believe that Russia would no longer pose a significant threat. However, over the following decades, former Warsaw Pact countries joined NATO and the EU, expanding Western political and military alliances closer towards Russia's borders. From Moscow's perspective, the West was encroaching upon areas it considered strategically important.

### Ukraine's Ambiguous Relationship with Russia and the West
For years, Ukraine walked a fine line in its relations with Russia and the West. It pursued closer economic ties with the EU but also maintained strong political and cultural bonds with Moscow. This created tensions, as Russia strongly opposed Ukraine integrating further with Western organizations like NATO. 

### The 2013-2014 Ukrainian Revolution and Russia's Annexation of Crimea
In late 2013, mass protests erupted in Kyiv after President Yanukovych rejected an EU association agreement. He was ousted in February 2014, but Russia viewed this as a Western-backed coup. It then annexed Crimea after a disputed referendum, inflaming tensions further. 

### The War in Donbas and Russia's Backing of Separatists
Armed conflict soon broke out between Ukrainian government forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Despite peace deals like Minsk II, fighting has continued for over seven years in the Donbas region along the Russian border.

### Growing NATO-Ukraine Cooperation and Russia's Security Concerns 
In recent years, NATO has strengthened cooperation with Ukraine and recognized it as an Enhanced Opportunities Partner. President Zelensky also pushed for Ukraine to eventually join the alliance. This alarmed Moscow, which viewed it as a major threat on its western border.

### Russia's Diplomatic Efforts and Military Buildup in 2021
In late 2021, Putin issued demands that NATO halt further expansion and remove forces from Eastern Europe. However, diplomacy made little headway, and around the same time Russia amassed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, raising alarms in the West.

### The Start of Russia's Full-Scale Invasion of Ukraine in 2022  
On February 24th, 2022, Putin ordered a large-scale military operation against Ukraine. Russian forces attacked along multiple fronts, capturing cities and territories but also facing stiff Ukrainian resistance backed by Western military aid.  

### Russia's Aims and Challenges in Continuing the War
Putin says Russia aims to "demilitarize" and "denazify" Ukraine. However, the invasion has faced difficulties and led to international isolation through sanctions. Sustaining the war effort over the long-term poses major economic and military challenges for Moscow.

### Broader Geopolitical Implications of the Ongoing Conflict
The war has shaken the post-Cold War security order in Europe. It could have consequences for Sino-Western relations as well as global economic stability depending on how long the fighting persists. The future of ties between Russia and the West also hangs in the balance.

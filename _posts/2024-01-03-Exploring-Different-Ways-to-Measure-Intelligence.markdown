### Brief History and Early Issues with IQ Tests
IQ tests were first developed in the early 20th century in Western countries to quantify human intelligence. However, they often contained cultural biases that inadvertently disadvantaged some ethnic groups whose experiences and contexts were unfamiliar to test designers. Over the years, test creators have worked to address these biases and improve tests like Raven's Progressive Matrices.

### Limitations of IQ Tests in Measuring True Intelligence
While IQ tests aim to measure intelligence, they predominantly assess visuo-linguistic and math skills within a narrow range. However, intelligence encompasses many other abilities not captured by standardized tests. Additionally, test performance can be influenced by non-cognitive factors like anxiety, test-taking experience, and coachingâ€”not truly reflective of one's intellectual capacity. IQ scores alone also poorly predict life success or job performance.

### What IQ Tests Actually Gauge
Proposed to quantitatively assess the efficiency of neuronal networks in processing information, IQ tests can only indirectly examine this concept through symbol- and pattern-based questions. They do not directly measure the workings of the brain. 

### Cultural Influences on Test Performance
Earlier IQ questions contained contexts unfamiliar to all cultures, placing some groups at a disadvantage through no fault of their own abilities. Even improved non-verbal sections still reflect modern Western environments rather than all life experiences. A lack of shared experiences and symbols among test designers and takers limit test validity and reliability across diverse populations.

### Impact of Environment on Perception and Problem-Solving  
Life experiences uniquely shape how individuals perceive and interpret visual information. For example, when an indigenous man was overwhelmed by the seemingly enormous size of cattle upon first exposure, his limited depth perception suggests his natural upbringing did not provide the same visual cues as modern city life. Tests reflecting only a narrow range of experiences fail to account for this environmental influence.

### Alternative Approaches to Raven's Progressive Matrices
While still limited, Raven's test uses geometric patterns to reduce linguistic and cultural influences. However, the abstract patterns themselves derive from modern urban contexts rather than all environments humans inhabit. More reflective alternatives could incorporate problems rooted in diverse natural and social settings.

### Advanced Brain Imaging and Real-World Assessment   
To truly gauge intelligence, neuroscientists require more sophisticated brain scanning technologies able to directly examine neuronal processing efficiency. Additionally, applying intellectual skills to solve tangible, open-ended problems mirroring challenges in everyday life may better reflect varied types of intelligence than standardized multiple choice questions.

### Conclusions on Measuring Human Intelligence
In summary, currently popular IQ tests possess unavoidable shortcomings in aiming to quantify the complex, multifaceted concept of intelligence across all individuals and groups. Future improvement relies on minimizing unintended cultural biases through culturally inclusive test design while exploring new direct and applied evaluation methods aligned with diverse ways intelligence naturally functions in real world contexts. Overall assessments must acknowledge both innate abilities and the profound impacts of environment and experience on development.

## Consider Your Audience 
Quora questions work best when they appeal to a wide audience. Take some time to think about popular topics that interest many readers. Also, reword your question in an engaging way to catch people's attention. Ask yourself - "Why would someone want to learn the answer to this question?" Make sure the question topic and language will appeal broadly.

## Provide Context
Give readers background context to help them understand why the question matters. Adding details in the question description helps readers get up to speed quickly so they're more inclined to engage. Take a paragraph or two to briefly explain the situation or event that prompted the question. Providing context creates interest and gives readers a fuller picture so they're equipped to thoughtfully respond.  

## Ask for Specific Answers
Directly ask experts in the topic for their perspectives by using Quora's "Ask to Answer" feature. Tag a few people you think could provide unique insight based on their backgrounds and areas of expertise. Signaling that you're looking for certain viewpoints from notable figures increases the chances they'll take the time to weigh in.  

## Increase Visibility
Periodically unfollowing and re-following your question is a simple tactic to push it back into more people's feeds and notifications. It's also a good idea to cite any old, related questions you or others have asked as context when posting answers to new discussions. Connecting questions like this expands audiences and allows useful information to reach more interested readers over time.

### Avoid Empty or Disingenuine Engagement  
It's best to avoid acknowledging questions you don't actually have insight on just for the sake of engagement. Empty responses that don't add value confuse and discourage real discussion. Instead of writing a meaningless reply, simply explain that you don't have experience in that area but wish the person asking finds helpful answers. Dishonest responses damage discussion quality - so it's better to be upfront about not knowing than leaving disingenuous feedback.

### Ask Directly for Answers
When you've asked a question and want to encourage specific people to weigh in, consider reaching out through other platforms as well. Send a brief, polite message on Twitter or LinkedIn mentioning the question and politely asking if they'd be willing to share thoughts on the topic. Directly reaching out conveys that you value their perspective and are actively seeking their input.

### Say "I Don't Know" Without Shame
It's perfectly acceptable - and in fact, preferable - to acknowledge gaps in your own knowledge rather than provide an uninformed response. Everyone has knowledge limits, so don't feel bad admitting what you don't understand. Saying "I don't know" prevents superficial, meaningless replies and shows that honest discussion is the priority over appearances. Difficult questions deserve considered answers, not forced responses devoid of insight.

### Take Time to Craft Thoughtful Responses
When answering questions, take the time needed to thoughtfully organize thoughts and find relevant examples or quotes that effectively explain the topic. Read answers out loud to catch awkward wording and improve clarity. High-quality responses naturally invite further discussion as readers are more engaged by well-researched, carefully-written perspectives. Rushing replies likely won't generate the same level of insightful back-and-forth.  

### Focus on the Community Over Self
While you're motivated to get answers for your own benefit and curiosity, remember that each discussion ultimately belongs to the broader Quora community. Make a conscious effort to draw others into the conversation by directly involving third parties and quoting their views in follow up questions rather than keeping the dialogue insular. The goal is thoughtful, engaging multi-part discussions that help many - not just curated answers solely meant for the original question asker. A community-oriented mindset builds active, collaborative discussions.

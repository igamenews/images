## Introduction 
Warriors of Chaos are currently lacking in both roster and campaign mechanics. This lengthy blog post provides in-depth suggestions on how to significantly overhaul the faction to make them more competitive on the battlefield and engaging to play in campaigns. By expanding units, updating lords and heroes, and reworking mechanics, Warriors of Chaos can compete with other factions and better represent their lore.

### Lacking faction needs an update
Warriors of Chaos have much untapped potential but currently lack diversity and unique campaign mechanics. With some focused changes to their roster, characters, and how corruption/mark bonuses work, this horde faction could become a challenging yet satisfying experience for players.

## Expanding the Roster
### Adding ranged and monster options  
Currently Warriors of Chaos lack effective ranged units, relying too heavily on melee. Giving access to throwing weapons like axes and javelins, as well as monsters from the lore, would add much-needed diversity. Units could also gain powerful bonuses thematically tied to each Chaos god's mark. 

### Bringing Daemons into the mortal ranks
Adding limited access to daemon units used by mono-god factions could provide new strategic and tactical options. Lesser demons like Nurglings or Bloodletters would complement the warriors while staying balanced. Larger monsters like dragons and slaughter-mutants represent an untapped faction identity in need of development.

## Improving Lords and Heroes
### Evolving characters into Daemon Princes  
Lords and heroes capably serve as generals but could have a more compelling progression. Allowing lords to become daemonic princes through battle prowess would tie into the lore and incentivize gameplay. Princes could customize abilities tied to their patron god's mark for memorable characters.

### Legendary champions for subfactions
Each chaos god deserves a named character to represent their followers. Legendary lords leading distinct factions devoted to Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch or Slaanesh would add lore-friendly depth and flavor.

 
## Subfaction Gameplay Focus
### Specializing subfactions through mechanics
Rather than remain uniform, chaos factions could each emphasize a different playstyle. For example, Khorne's might continue pushing battles while Nurgle spread plagues. Tzeentch manipulates enemies through vassals. Distinctive mechanics would make choosing a subfaction a meaningful strategic decision.

## Unit Progression System
### Evolving warriors through battle
Few factions embody relentless warfare like the Warriors of Chaos. A system allowing basic marauders and warriors to rise through the ranks with experience would appropriately tie gameplay to their bloody culture. Heroes could gain similar upgrades all the way to daemonic mounts that symbolize ascension.

## Corruption and Public Order Rework
### Summoning chaos through corruption  
Rather than just lowering public order, high corruption levels could spawn reinforcements for the Warriors. Hordes of marauders or even minor demons would emerge from the tainted lands to aid their masters. This dynamic system captures chaos erupting throughout the realm.

## Mark of Chaos Undivided Utility  
### Access to all gods' gifts  
Factions devoted to all four ruinous powers could gain signature bonuses. Drawing upon each god's daemons, spells and warriors represents an alliance spanning the ruinous powers. Hybrid demonic units might also emerge from this unholy confluence of influences.

## Conclusion
With these extensiveproposed changes, Warriors of Chaos have potential to compete viably on the battlefield through tactical diversity. Meanwhile, their campaigns could immerse players in suitably grim and compelling mechanics that embody each chaos god's distinct identity. By expanding options while focusing subfactions, this update would make Warriors of Chaos a highly rewarding yet challenging experience befitting their dread lore.

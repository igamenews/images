### When Faced with a Wrath of Multiple Olympians  
Zeus, Poseidon, Hades and Hera working together would spell near certain doom for any mortal. Facing the combined might and fury of these gods would be a hopeless endeavor. However, Hecate's magical abilities may provide the best chance of survival. As the goddess of magic, crossroads, witchcraft, and the night, Hecate wields great mystical power. Her ability to obscure and hide ones presence even from other gods could shield one from their detection and wrath. While antagonizing all four at once would be foolish, Hecate offers mortals the best probability of evading their wrath should such a scenario arise.

### Requesting Intervention to Stop Conflict
Seeking the assistance of goddesses like Hestia or Artemis may succeed in quelling divine disputes peacefully. Hestia, goddess of the hearth, home, and family, commands profound respect as the eldest daughter of Kronos and Rhea. Her gentle, non-confrontational nature makes her well-suited to influencing others towards reconciliation. As a goddess associated with childbirth, domesticity, and family, Artemis too rejects conflict and could sway gods embroiled in strife. Both wield influence through empathy, wisdom and calm persuasion over aggression. Appealing to their virtues offers the best path to cessation of divine quarrels without inflaming tensions further.  

### Turning to Athena for Her Wisdom
When confronted with complex problems with no easy answers, turning to Athena for her sagacity and level-headed counsel presents the wisest choice. As the goddess of wisdom, crafts, and strategic warfare, Athena evaluates all perspectives with balanced, unbiased reasoning. Where ego and emotion cause strife between gods, her intelligent, pragmatic thinking finds solutions respecting all viewpoints. Though a major goddess, Athena prioritizes intelligence over bravado and understands nuance in conflicts. By demonstrating respect and appealing to her virtues of wisdom, strategy, and fairness, she offers mortals the most reasonable chance of aid and mediation in divisive issues.

### Hiding From the Gods' Pursuit
Should one truly antagonize and provoke the wrath of the gods through severe wrongdoings, more proactive measures may be required. In such dire straits where the gods seek retribution, Hecate again proves the most prudent deity to appeal to. As the goddess of magic, crossroads, ghosts, and witchcraft, Hecate wields formidable occult powers beyond any other divinity. She possesses the unique ability to shroud others from perception and detection, even masking their presence from omnipotent gods like Zeus. With her mystical arts of obscurement, Hecate offers mortals the sole means of potentially evading and eluding pursuit by the Olympians seeking vengeance. Behind her veil, one may have a chance to escape their grasps, at least temporarily, where no other has hope.

### Seeking a Benevolent Deity  
For mortals simply requiring assistance, wisdom or empowerment without provoking wrath, kinder goddesses make safer choices. Hestia remains the picture of warmth, hospitality and protection of the household. Likewise, Artemis embodies motherly care for women, children and the natural world. As the wife of Hephaestus, a crippled god, Aglaea evinces compassion and sees past physicality. Hebe brings vigor and cheer as the goddess of youth. For honest hard work without complaint, appealing to Hephaestus and his craftsmanship proves reasonably prudent. Each keeps to noble roles avoiding petty dramas, responding to real injustices against them and others with persistence, not vengeance. By respecting their goodly virtues over wrathful capriciousness, one receives aid safely from benevolent divinities.  

### Conclusion
The varied dispositions and powers of the Olympians dictate who proves most prudent to appeal to in differing crises. Calculating each god's temperament, priorities and abilities determines the best, lowest risk assurance of divine intervention or succor. While angering all guarantees doom, cleverly playing to virtues like compassion, wisdom and magic offers mortals viable chances of surmounting hardships. Respect, honestly representing one's plight and invoking deities' better natures provides the optimum probability of aid and maybe even favor, should providence require otherworldly assistance. With prudent reflection, mortals can call to divine protectors increasing their resilience against misfortune.

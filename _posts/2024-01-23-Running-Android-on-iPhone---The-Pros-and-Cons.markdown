## Is it truly possible?
While running the full Android operating system on an iPhone is not feasible due to hardware and software incompatibilities, it is possible to modify parts of the iPhone experience through a process called jailbreaking. Jailbreaking grants lower-level system access that allows installing applications and tweaks not approved by Apple's strict App Store guidelines. 

## What is jailbreaking?
Jailbreaking iOS devices provides administrative privileges otherwise restricted by Apple. Once jailbroken, users can download software from third-party sources rather than being limited to the App Store. Popular tools for jailbreaking include Cydia and Unc0ver. Common tweaks allow customizing the iPhone's appearance with custom icon packs and wallpapers. Additional functionality can be accessed like more advanced system settings and the ability to directly browse and modify the iPhone's file system.

### Customizing the Lockscreen and Homescreen
Through tweaks, jailbroken iPhones offer much more customization potential for the lockscreen and homescreens compared to stock iOS. Popular tweaks let users fully theme every visual aspect from app icons and folders to status bar designs and Control Center panels. Even features like custom screenshot gestures and additional app shortcuts can be added.

## The legality of jailbreaking
In the United States, jailbreaking personal devices is legal due to exemptions granted under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). However, Apple still maintains that jailbreaking violates their intended use of iOS and can compromise security. While legal, jailbreaking typically voids the iPhone's hardware warranty since it modifies the device's software.

### Possible risks from jailbreaking
As with any process that grants root access, there are inherent security risks if proper precautions are not followed. Unstable or buggy tweaks run the risk of slowing down performance or causing glitches that may require restoring the iPhone to factory settings. Jailbreaking also comes with the risk of not receiving future iOS updates which could impact compatibility of existing tweaks over time.

## Additional functionality from jailbreaking
Once jailbroken, iPhones gain significantly expanded control possibilities. Native file system access lets users freely move app data, photos and documents around like on a computer. Sideloading allows installing software from any external source rather than only Apple's App Store. Tweaks let tether the iPhone to share its internet connection or enable more technically advanced modifications not possible on stock iOS. 

### Expanding compatibility with Android apps
While true multi-booting is still out of reach, certain services like CrossOver enable running select Android applications on jailbroken iPhones. The ability to install Android apps provides expanded options compared to iOS' more limited selections. However, performance depends on how well each app translates between the two very different operating systems. Many graphical elements or hardware features simply may not function properly.

## Alternatives if avoiding jailbreaking
For those wishing to keep warranty coverage or avoid any potential security risks, iOS provides options for a similar Android-like experience within Apple's limitations. The App Store offers various Android launchers and icon packs to change up the homescreen look. Cloud computing services can stream individual Android apps from remote servers over the internet to iPhones. Dual booting in virtual machines shows promise but comes with its own sets of limitations.

### Customizing within stock iOS bounds 
Even without jailbreaking, iOS provides decent customization depth. Options like alternative icon packs, wallpapers, ringtones and widgets allow personalizing the homescreen and lockscreen aesthetic. Siri Shortcuts and Automator expand functionality through programmed actions and workflows. Apps also offer features replicating some of jailbreaking's most common tweaks within Apple's permissions.

## Weighing the pros and cons
While jailbreaking offers expanded control and customization possibilities, risks need evaluating against user needs and technical abilities. Security vulnerabilities and potential troubleshooting requirements receive eliminating the iPhone's warranty protection should issues arise. For those seeking Android app functionality or system tweaks, alternatives exist with lower risks staying within stock iOS bounds. Weighing advantages vs disadvantages differently impacts the best choice per individual's priorities and skill level.

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, completely running Android on iPhones remains infeasible due to fundamental hardware and software differences between the two platforms. However, jailbreaking provides methods customizing the iOS experience and even running select Android apps through third-party services. Alternatives within stock iOS also replicate some features for those preferring official software support. Overall the best approach depends on one's priorities between functionality, security and technical expertise when considering options "Android-ifying" iPhones.

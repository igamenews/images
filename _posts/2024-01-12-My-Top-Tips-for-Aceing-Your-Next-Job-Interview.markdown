### Tell me about yourself
Growing up, I've always had a passion for technology and design. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Computer Science, where I developed skills in web development, user experience design, and project management. For the past three years, I've worked as a full stack developer at Anthropic, where I led the design and development of their new consumer-facing website. Some of my strengths include problem-solving, communication, and attention to detail. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing basketball, and learning new piano pieces.

### Focus on how you will benefit the employer
Throughout my career, I've focused on using technology to solve real problems and create positive impact. At my last role, I revamped Anthropic's website which increased new user signups by 35%. By streamlining the onboarding process and optimizing for mobile, we were able to engage many more customers. If chosen for this position, I believe I can utilize skills like frontend development, user research, and project management to help scale your operations as well. My proven track record of shipping features that improve metrics shows I'm focused on the bottom line.

### Emphasize why you are uniquely qualified  
With a computer science degree and experience designing consumer products, I bring a rare mix of technical skills and user-centered mindset. Most applicants you'll speak to are either strong programmers or product designers - but I truly excel at both. I also have extensive knowledge in Python, React, and machine learning through independent study projects. My passion for lifelong learning and solving interdisciplinary problems makes me well-suited for fast-paced roles like this one.

### Research the company thoroughly
After reviewing your website and annual reports, I'm excited by Company X's mission of using AI to benefit humanity. Initiatives like supporting climate change research really resonate with my own interests. I was also impressed by your work on translational models for healthcare - democratizing medical knowledge could have huge societal impacts. Based on my background in full stack development, I believe I'm a natural fit to help advance projects in these ambitious yet meaningful areas. I would love to learn more about potential new directions and how I could utilize my skills to directly support these initiatives.

### Demonstrate interest in the role 
The full stack developer position captured my interest because it aligns strongly with skills I've been developing for years. Building complete web applications from the ground up utilizing modern technologies like React, Flask, and PostgreSQL is something I excel at based on professional projects and side work. Responsibilities like implementing APIs, practicing Agile methodologies in Git, and deploying products to cloud services are core strengths of mine. Conducting user tests and iteratively refining designs also appeals to my focus on pragmatic, user-centered problem solving. I believe I'm well-suited to hit the ground running in this role.

### Be self-aware when discussing motivation
Ever since I can remember, I've been intrinsically driven to build things, solve problems, and learn new skills. Throughout challenging projects, this motivation has helped me push through setbacks andSHIP features ahead of schedule. For example, during an independent full-stack coding project over the summer, I taught myself GraphQL while implementing it from scratch to optimize an API - an experience that tremendously improved my abilities. Going above and beyond to continually better myself and produce tangible results are what fuel my work. I'm confident this motivation will serve me exceptionally well in helping Company X succeed.

### Prepare stories using the STAR method
One challenge I overcame was optimizing my previous company's website for multiple device form factors. The situation was that our main webpage took too long to load on mobile, negatively impacting user experience and conversion rates. To tackle this, I analyzed load times with Chrome DevTools and identified frontend code as the culprit (Task). I optimized images, minified code, and implemented code splitting (Action). These changes reduced load time by 30%, improving our bounce rate and conversions (Result). From this experience, I learned the importance of performance optimization and how to systematically diagnose frontend issues.

### Ask questions to the interviewer
I have a few questions if you don't mind: What stage is the team currently in and what kinds of projects are a top priority? How involved are developers in planning products from concept to launch? What opportunities exist here for growth into adjacent roles over time? Also, what does the onboarding process look like and is there budget for continuing education resources? Thank you again for your consideration - I'm excited about the potential to contribute to meaningful work here.

### Follow up promptly and professionally
Thank you Chris for your time yesterday - it was great learning more about Company X's mission and culture. As we discussed, I believe my experience building full-stack web applications and passion for AI safety research make me an excellent match. Please let me know if any other information would be helpful as you evaluate candidates. I'm looking forward to the possibility of contributing to projects that can create real positive change.

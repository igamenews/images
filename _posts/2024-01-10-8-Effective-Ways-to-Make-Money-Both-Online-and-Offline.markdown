### Find your passion and solve problems
Solving problems through your passion and skills is a great way to make money. Consider your interests like writing, comedy, photography etc. Then identify issues people face that you can help with. For example, if you enjoy writing you could start a blog teaching skills or provide helpful content. People will appreciate useful information and pay for quality solutions. Focus first on making an impact before focusing on profits.

### Provide valuable services   
Look around your local community and identify lacking services people need. Things like tutoring, pet sitting, handywork, event planning etc are all valuable services people pay for regularly. Fill gaps in your area by advertising your skills and reliability. Word-of-mouth will grow your customer base over time as you gain positive reviews. Prioritize a niche without much competition.

### Buy and resell valuable products
Do market research to find fast-selling items you can purchase more cheaply elsewhere to resell online or locally. Many successful entrepreneurs start by dropshipping or reselling products on platforms like Amazon and eBay. Look for opportunities by browsing trending categories. Make sure there's demand for the products and you can source them affordably so you make a profit on each sale. Build an online shop or promote on social media to reach customers efficiently.

### Become a dropshipper  
Partner with companies that allow individuals to become authorized resellers without holding inventory. Take customer orders on your own website or store then pass the details to your suppliers who directly fulfill and ship items to buyers. You keep the difference between what the customer pays versus your discounted wholesale cost as profit without risk or upfront investment beyond basic website or marketing costs.

### Invest in profitable businesses
Watch emerging industries and growing business models serving new needs. Consider investing small amounts regularly in companies well-positioned for long term growth through advantages like innovative products, brand loyalty, competitive edge or addressing basic necessities. For example, allocating $50 monthly into a reliable paint manufacturer over many years can gain significant returns through stock appreciation and dividends. Diversify investments for lower risk.

### Sell valuable reservations  
Have you ever wanted a reservation at a popular new restaurant but it's booked far in advance? You can offer to sell highly coveted reservations you secure for others for a small fee. For instance, booking a table then listing it on a site like Craigslist or Facebook groups for a $20-$50 premium depending on the demand and exclusivity. It takes little effort but can earn several hundred dollars within a day if you continuously list hard-to-get reservations.  

### Provide freelance services online
With the ability to work remotely, websites like Upwork, Fiverr and Freelancer connect freelancers to clients worldwide wanting projects completed. Sign up with a profile highlighting your skills then bid on available jobs advertising your rates. Over time, build a portfolio and reviews to land larger contracts. Consider video/graphic design, programming, writing, administrative tasks - industries always need on-demand talent. The flexible hours allow pursuing multiple gigs simultaneously.

### Sell valuable skills with Excel
A basic Excel proficiency opens career opportunities across fields handling data analysis, budgeting, forecasting and more. Familiarity with functions, formulas, charting, pivot tables and macros makes you adept at extracting insights. Employers in finance, accounting, operations and consulting pay well for these talents. Self-study with online courses to progress your abilities and land roles paying $80,000+ annually without advanced degrees by proving your Excel mastery on assessments and trials. Continuous learning keeps skills marketable.

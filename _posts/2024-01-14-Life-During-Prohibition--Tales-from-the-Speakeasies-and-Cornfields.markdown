### Untaxed Moonshine in the Midwest 
Moonshining was a common way for farmers to earn extra income during Prohibition. Many modified old engines and trailers to discreetly transport barrels of untaxed corn liquor. Remote areas like abandoned boiler sheds on farmland were used to operate stills. While illegal, moonshining helped struggling families make ends meet during hard times.

### Did Prohibition Really Reduce Drinking?
Some historians argue Prohibition had positive health impacts like lower rates of alcohol-related diseases and accidents. Mortality rates from cirrhosis and mental illness admissions declined during this period. However, others note how unregulated underground drinking led to larger health risks from contaminated alcohol. Overall consumption may have decreased publicly but demand remained, driven underground without oversight.

### Early Gun Control in Meiji Period Japan
In 1876, the Japanese government enacted the Hait≈çrei Edict banning the open carrying of swords and firearms. This helped establish norms discouraging a gun culture in Japan that some see as contributing to lower rates of gun violence today. While controversial, it shows how restrictive firearm policies can shape a society's relationship with weapons over generations.  

### Speakeasies: Unregulated Booze and Mob Rule  
Underground bars called "speakeasies" flourished during Prohibition as the only place to purchase alcohol. However, these lacked any health regulations on production or quality control. This allowed dangerous chemicals and additives to contaminate drinks, harming or even killing customers. Mob bosses also used speakeasies to expand their criminal empires and control territory through threats of violence.

### The Rise of Organized Crime 
Prohibition vastly empowered criminal organizations that provided the highly lucrative illegal alcohol trade. The Mafia expanded operations and influenced politics through corruption and intimidation during this period. However, their influence waned after Prohibition when they lost this revenue stream. Some argue more tolerant drug policies today have weakened organized crime compared to the unrestrained profiteering allowed by Prohibition.

### Billions in Black Market Profits
The black market for untaxed booze became a huge business during Prohibition, valued in the billions. Bootleggers transported liquor through secret tunnels, hidden compartments, and altered vehicles to evade detection. Farms and warehouses concealed distilling operations worth small fortunes. These untaxed profits enriched criminals at the expense of lost government tax revenue that could have funded social programs.

### Regulating Vice Post-Prohibition    
After repeal, policies emerged like the 21st Amendment, drinking ages, and licensing systems. This created regulated systems for once-illicit businesses and helped reduce associated social harms. In contrast, the pre-Prohibition saloon culture lacked rules around hours, drinking age, hygiene, or types of service allowed. Post-repeal norms established moderation over total abstinence.

### A Catalyst for Corruption and Violence
Prohibition corruption infiltrated policing as bootleggers paid off authorities to overlook operations. It also funded the rise of organized crime groups that fought increasingly violent turf wars over supply routes and customer bases. Remote areas saw gang standoffs as rivals ambushed shipments in industries now worth more than oil. This lawlessness showed how black markets breed greater harms than regulated vices.

### Why Prohibition Ultimately Failed
By the late 1920s, Prohibition had lost legitimacy and widespread public support. Most saw it as an overreach that criminalized social behaviors while empowering dangerous underground economies. This unenforceable and culturally rejected policy sparked a reform movement that led to its repeal. In the end, people continued drinking with little effect on public health, showing that moderation, education and regulated commerce are preferable to broad prohibitions on vice.

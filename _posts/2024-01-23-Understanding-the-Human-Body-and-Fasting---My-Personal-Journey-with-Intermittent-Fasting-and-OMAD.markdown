## Introduction to Intermittent Fasting and Types of Fasts

The human body is remarkably resilient and can survive extended periods without food. Various fasting methods have emerged that tap into this resilience for health and wellness goals. Intermittent fasting involves restricting eating to specific windows each day, like only eating between 12pm-8pm. Another common approach is fasting 1-2 days per week. 

###One Meal a Day

One Meal a Day, or OMAD, means consuming all calories for the day in a single evening meal. This provides an extended daily fast of 20 hours or more. Longer water fasts of 3-10 days are also practiced but require electrolyte and nutrient supplementation. Overall, different fasting styles allow various health benefits while generally being safe when adapted gradually and with supervision if needed.

## What Happens to the Body During a Fast  

When food intake stops, the body immediately begins utilizing stored glucose and glycogen for energy. Around 24 hours of fasting, the liver increases ketone production from fat breakdown to fuel tissues. Unhealthy and damaged cells are preferentially broken down through autophagy to provide amino acids. 

###Spare Vital Organs

The process of autophagy and ketosis protects lean muscle mass and vital organ function. Recycling intracellular waste prevents it from building up systemically. Throughout, normal functions like cognitive performance are supported by ketones and residual glucose from glycogen stores. 

## My Personal Journey with Intermittent Fasting and OMAD

At my heaviest weight of 375 pounds, I was reliant on 200 units of insulin daily as a type 2 diabetic. Out of desperation, I started cutting back on snacks and reducing meal frequency in 2021. Within a few short months, my insulin needs dropped significantly as I lost initial weight.

###Transition to OMAD 

The changes inspired me to transition fully to OMAD. Adapting my relationship with food this way, I continued seeing progress in terms of weight loss, health markers, and overall wellbeing. My new lifestyle just felt natural and sustainable long term.

## Benefits of My Fasting Journey So Far

After a full year practicing OMAD, I no longer require any diabetic medications or insulin injections. Overall I have lost 125 pounds from my highest weight. Bloodwork shows my metabolic health is vastly improved, with normal blood glucose and A1C levels maintained without drugs.

###Utilized Stored Fat

Through bypassing the need to constantly digest meals, my body learned to efficiently use stored fat for fuel. This burning of excessive adipose reserves in turn helped control my diabetes and shred dangerous visceral fat specifically. My fasting lifestyle became the cornerstone of managing my health condition naturally.

## Potential Risks and Recommendations

While generally safe when done properly, fasting does carry potential side effects if not appropriately adapted to one's circumstances and health profile. Some documented issues include gallstones from rapid weight loss or nutritional deficiencies from insufficient electrolytes during water fasts.  

###Gradual Reduction

For these reasons, rapidly jumping from a standard American diet and 3 meals per day straight into OMAD is not advised. A more gradual 1-2 week period reducing portion sizes, processed carbs, and snacking frequency first helps ease the body into a fasted state smoothly to avoid issues. Supplementing electrolytes on longer water fasts also prevents risks.

## Physical and Mental Effects

On a cellular level, fasting triggers natural waste removal and repair processes in the body like autophagy and ketosis. Not having to constantly digest food diverts energy towards self-cleansing and regeneration instead.

###Increased Mental Clarity

Cognitively, stabilized blood sugar and reduced inflammation provide heightened mental clarity compared to the peaks and valleys from frequent eating. Some proponents also attribute these qualities to increased BDNF production, supporting nerve growth and anti-aging properties. Overall, fasting aids rejuvenation mentally as well as physically.

## Sustainability and Long-Term Effects

Nearly two years into intermittent fasting and OMAD specifically, I find this lifestyle very maintainable long term. Steady weight management has transitioned into weight stabilization at a lighter, healthier level. 

###Continued Improvements

Rather than experiencing declining effects, ongoing health optimizations have been noticeable in areas like blood pressure, lipid panels, energy levels, mood stability, stomach discomfort resolution, and joint flexibility. All signs point to intermittent fasting providing wide-reaching benefits sustainable long term when adapted gradually and followed consistently.

## Addressing Common Concerns 

Contrary to popular assumptions, intermittent fasting conducted properly under medical guidance shows minimal risks and no evidence of danger when adapted carefully based on an individual's situation. Anecdotally, many experience notable improvements following various fasting regimens across both genders and ages.  

### Invalid Reasons

Arguments alleging health risks as an excuse to continuously eat or claims of "starvation mode" sabotaging weight loss have little clinical research backing. Similarly, issues like fasting supposedly reducing clothing sizes to hurt businesses profits represent invalid concerns not rooted in science or users' wellbeing. Overall, intermittent fasting shows great promise worth balanced, evidence-based consideration.

## Conclusion

My personal story clearly shows intermittent fasting, and OMAD specifically, can profoundly transform health and quality of life when implemented cautiously yet consistently long term. While individual results vary, tapping into the human body's inherent fasting resilience appears a promising adjunct or alternative worth trying under medical guidance depending on an individual's goals and circumstances. With discipline, care, support, and tailored optimization over time, intermittent fasting may continue serving myself and others well into the foreseeable future.

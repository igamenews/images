## Introduction
Jailbreaking allows users to customize their iOS devices beyond Apple's limitations. By removing software restrictions, jailbreaking lets users modify system files and install unauthorized apps. There are different types of jailbreaks that allow varying levels of customization. 

### What is Jailbreaking?
Jailbreaking removes the limitations imposed by Apple on iOS, allowing users to modify system files, install unofficial apps, and tweak nearly every aspect of the operating system. The practice originated with the original iPhone in 2007 when hackers found ways to uninstall native apps and "jailbreak" the phone. Despite Apple's attempts to close loopholes over the years, the jailbreaking community continues discovering new exploits.

### Types of Jailbreaks
The main jailbreak types are tethered, untethered, and semi-tethered. A tethered jailbreak requires the device to be plugged into a computer each time it reboots. Untethered jailbreaks allow the device to be booted without a computer. Semi-tethered jailbreaks let the device reboot without a computer connection but require it to rerun the jailbreak process after a reboot. Untethered jailbreaks offer the most flexibility.

## Benefits of Jailbreaking
Jailbreaking opens up additional customization and capabilities on iOS. Users gain control over every aspect of the operating system.

### Customization with Tweaks and Themes  
Jailbreaking provides access to thousands of modifications known as "tweaks" that can customize the iOS interface, add new features, and tweak existing apps. Popular tweaks let users modify the lock screen, control center, notifications and more. Extensive icon and UI theme libraries provide visual customization.

### Alternative App Stores
The decentralized Cydia platform allows installing apps not available on the official App Store. Users can access paid apps for free or install apps not approved by Apple. Alternative app stores like Ignition and AppValley also provide access to more software selection.

### System-Level Modifications
With root access through jailbreaking, advanced users can modify system files, install custom firmware, and tweak underlying OS functions not normally accessible. This level of control expands what iOS devices can do.

## Risks of Jailbreaking
While jailbreaking enables significant customization, it also introduces potential vulnerabilities. Bypassing Appleâ€™s software restrictions means losing built-in security protections.

### Bypassing Security Features  
Jailbreaking disables built-in iOS security mechanisms like sandboxing, which isolates each app's data and activities from other apps and the system. This increases risks of malware, system instability from conflicting tweaks, and app sideloading vulnerabilities.

### Potential for Malware
Without Apple's app review process, jailbroken devices face higher chances of unwittingly installing malware or pirated apps containing malware from alternative app stores or unauthorized app installations. Malicious software can steal data, monitor users, or damage devices.

### Loss of Updates and Support
Jailbreaking voids manufacturer warranties, and jailbroken devices often cannot receive the latest iOS updates and security patches from Apple. Missing out on updates leaves devices vulnerable to newly discovered exploits and bugs. Apple also will not provide technical support for jailbroken devices. 

### Possible Issues During Updates
Major iOS updates sometimes render existing jailbreaks unusable until updated. Reverting from an unsigned jailbreak prevents booting the device until restoring in DFU mode wipes all data and settings. Updating a jailbroken device also risks getting stuck in a non-booting state requiring restoring.

## Compatibility and Requirements
Not all jailbreak tools support every iOS version or device model. Only certain versions and devices can currently be jailbroken.

### Supported Devices and iOS Versions
Jailbreaks typically support the latest few iOS versions and most recent generation of iPhones and iPads but not all devices. Older devices tend to have more jailbreak options since exploitable bugs have been found. Check compatibility charts on jailbreak sites before attempting to jailbreak.

### Computer Requirements
A computer running macOS or Windows is needed to jailbreak most devices. The computer needs the latest version of iTunes installed and must support the connecting iOS device type via USB. Jailbreak tools and drivers must also be compatible with the operating system. 

### Pre-Jailbreak Steps
Some basic preparations are recommended before starting a jailbreak. Disable any passcodes, Face ID, or Touch ID before putting the device into recovery mode. Also log out of iCloud and disable Find My iPhone to prevent the device from remotely wiping.

## Jailbreaking Process
Once compatibility and requirements are verified, the actual jailbreaking steps involve downloading the necessary tools then putting the device into recovery mode to run the jailbreak payload. 

### Downloading Tools
Popular jailbreak tools include Pangu, TaiG, Electra and checkra1n. They should only be downloaded from the original developer websites or trusted third party jailbreak sites. Be wary of fakes as jailbreaking correctly requires the legitimate software and sources.

### Entering Recovery Mode  
Recovery mode is needed to run the jailbreak code. This often requires pressing specific button combinations while connecting to a computer. Detailed on-screen instructions guide putting the device in the correct reboot state.

### Following On-Screen Instructions
Step-by-step prompts walk through authorizing the jailbreak tools in iTunes or on the device screen. The tool then exploits the iOS vulnerabilities to gain root access and install the necessary jailbreak files. 

### Respringing and Completion
After a few minutes of processing, the device will "respring" or reboot to complete the jailbreak setup. Upon rebooting, Cydia and a suite of default jailbreak applications will be installed, confirming a successful jailbreak.

## Alternatives to Jailbreaking
For those wanting more app selection without security risks, some alternatives exist to access extra content without a full jailbreak.

### Alternative App Stores  
Unofficial app libraries like AppValley and TweakBox offer app sideloading without jailbreaking via dynamic signing of IPAs. Only a few taps are needed to install third-party apps straight from the store.

### IPA Sideloading with Cydia Impactor
Cydia Impactor uses development certificates to sideload IPAs without jailbreaking. It signs apps for up to 7 days until they need resigning. While limited, it provides a lower-risk method to install specific non-App Store apps. 

### Using Family/Friends Apple IDs
Borrowing or sharing login credentials for Apple IDs that have purchased apps allows downloading paid content without owning it. App library sharing within family groups is another legitimate way to access more apps.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Jailbreaking inevitably leads to various common questions about risks, removal, and potential issues.

### Does Jailbreaking Void the Warranty?
Legally, jailbreaking alone does not void Apple's limited warranty. However, Apple reserves refusing warranty service or support for jailbroken devices experiencing issues possibly related to or exacerbated by jailbreaking.

### How Do I Un-Jailbreak My Device?
To restore a jailbroken device fully, put it into recovery mode and update/restore through iTunes. This wipes all data and settings, and reinstalls the latest signed iOS version, removing the jailbreak. Alternatively, some jailbreaks include an un-jailbreak option in Cydia. 

### Can the Device Brick During Jailbreaking?
While rare, bricking or getting stuck in a reboot loop is a risk when exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system. The likelihood depends on factors like device model, iOS version, and jailbreak tool used. Following all steps carefully helps prevent issues.

## Future of iOS Jailbreaking 

As long as restrictive firmware signing policies continue, the cat-and-mouse game of jailbreaking iOS will likely persist. However, Apple's increasingly secure software and hardware make future jailbreaks tougher to develop.

### Checkm8 Jailbreak Bootrom Exploit
The unpatchable bootrom exploit called checkm8 changes the game, potentially enabling jailbreaks on all 64-bit iOS devices indefinitely. It remains to be seen how the community utilizes this powerful low-level chip vulnerability over the long term.

### More Secure Future iOS Updates
New security measures like read-only system volume partitions and debugger/kernel code signing in iOS 13 put up bigger barriers. Jailbreaks will face greater obstacles keeping pace with Apple's advancing defensive techniques lowering the window of exploitability.

## Conclusion

In summary, iOS jailbreaking sacrifices security and stability for ultimate customization freedom. While enabling thousands of tweaks, themes and alternative apps, bypassing iOS restrictions introduces higher chances of malware, voided warranties and update incompatibilities. Those willing to take the risks gain control over every iOS aspect in exchange. Others can still access more content through signing workarounds with less complication and fewer vulnerabilities. Overall, jailbreaking remains an intriguing hacker pastime continually pitting jailbreakers against Apple's security teams.
